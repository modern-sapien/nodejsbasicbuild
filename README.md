# nodejssbasicbuild
simple run through of node js basics for practicing builds / setup and referencing.

In this super simple reference repository, we do some basic demos of packages included in node.js; file system, operating system, http, logger & url. Each demo of included packages are in the reference folder with their respective file names. 

To explore these all you have to do is npm init & npm install & run node on the associated demo file from within the reference or main directories.
